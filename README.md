sink
====

Sink is a minimal programming language for embedding small scripts in larger programs, with
TypeScript and C99 implementations.  It is specifically designed to be small, simple, and easily
embeddable, with support for a REPL as used in debug consoles.

**Note: sink is currently in [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta)**

### Sink the Language

First read the [Crash Course](https://github.com/voidqk/sink/blob/master/docs/crash-course.md)
tutorial to understand how to write sink code.

You can play with the [Online Demo](https://rawgit.com/voidqk/sink/master/dist/repl.html) to test
language features in a REPL.

The [Standard Library](https://github.com/voidqk/sink/blob/master/docs/lib.md) documents all
commands that come with sink out of the box.
